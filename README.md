## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 17

## Self-Reflection:
I used the website to do the homework, and sometimes I relied on the example too much and always direct move the example to the function without learning how to use it. Especially with obj4, I took too long to do it. And I should rely on the terminal to find what I did wrong, otherwise I will stuck there and do not know what should I do next.

### How long it took me to finish this?
About 3-4 hours
